    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Warm the milk in the microwave or a saucepan until just lukewarm. Place in a jug (if in the saucepan). Add the yeast and sugar. Use a skewer to stir until combined. Set aside for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to become frothy.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Use a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment to combine flour and salt. Add milk mixture. Beat until just combined. Scrape down side of bowl then continue beating for 3 minutes or until a soft, sticky dough. Grease a bowl with oil. Turn dough onto a lightly oiled surface. Shape into a ball. Place in prepared bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 45 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Pour oil into a large wide saucepan until half full. Place over medium-high heat. Heat to 180C on a cook’s thermometer (see tip). </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Use oiled hands to divide dough into 6 portions. Working with 1 at a time on a lightly oiled surface, roll out or press dough into a 16cm-diameter disc, making it slightly thicker around the edge. Drop gently into oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes each side or until puffed and golden brown. Use tongs to carefully lift out and drain on a plate lined with paper towel. Repeat with the remaining dough portions. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Rub warm flatbread with cut garlic. Top with sour cream, cheese, bacon and parsley. </p>
